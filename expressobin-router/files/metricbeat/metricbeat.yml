########################## Metricbeat Configuration ###########################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see metricbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/index.html

#============================  Config Reloading ===============================

# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.
metricbeat.config.modules:

  # Glob pattern for configuration reloading
  path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml

  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 10s

  # Set to true to enable config reloading
  reload.enabled: false

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a metricset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.
metricbeat.max_start_delay: 10s

#============================== Autodiscover ===================================

# Autodiscover allows you to detect changes in the system and spawn new modules
# as they happen.

#metricbeat.autodiscover:
  # List of enabled autodiscover providers
#  providers:
#    - type: docker
#      templates:
#        - condition:
#            equals.docker.container.image: etcd
#          config:
#            - module: etcd
#              metricsets: ["leader", "self", "store"]
#              period: 10s
#              hosts: ["${host}:2379"]

#=========================== Timeseries instance ===============================

# Enabling this will add a `timeseries.instance` keyword field to all metric
# events. For a given metricset, this field will be unique for every single item
# being monitored.
# This setting is experimental.

#timeseries.enabled: false


#==========================  Modules configuration =============================

  # if no error is encountered.
  #slow_start: false

  # The number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to Logstash
  # after a network error. After waiting backoff.init seconds, the Beat

  # authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
  # matches the names identified within the certificate.
  # * strict, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
  # authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
  # matches the names identified within the certificate. If the Subject Alternative
  # Name is empty, it returns an error.
  # * certificate, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a
  # trusted authority (CA), but does not perform any hostname verification.
  #  * none, which performs no verification of the server's certificate. This
  # mode disables many of the security benefits of SSL/TLS and should only be used
  # after very careful consideration. It is primarily intended as a temporary
  # diagnostic mechanism when attempting to resolve TLS errors; its use in
  # production environments is strongly discouraged.

  # The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
  # After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
